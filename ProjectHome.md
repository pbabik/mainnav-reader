This tiny tool reads out and deletes tracklog data from mainnav gps devices either via USB or Bluetooth. The downloaded tracks are stored as GPX-files.

Currently works with:

  * Mainnav MG-600
  * Mainnav MW-705
  * Mainnav MG-910 "pictoGEO"
  * Mainnav MG-950d
  * Mainnav MG-950dl
  * Mainnav MG-950dm
  * QStarz BT-Q2000

If you have a GPS-device from Mainnav that is not listed here but does work with mainnav-reader, please let me know. If it doesn't work, but you're interested in getting it to work, you can contact me aswell.

For installation instructions, see the ReadMe wiki-page.
